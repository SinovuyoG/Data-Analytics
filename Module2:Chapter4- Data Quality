Data Manipulation

Data manipulation in data analytics refers to the process of transforming and preparing raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis. It involves various operations aimed at cleaning, organizing, and enhancing the data to extract meaningful insights. Let's delve into each area:
7.	Recording data: Recording data involves the initial step of capturing data from different sources such as databases, files, sensors, or online sources. This may include structured data stored in databases, semi-structured data like CSV files, or unstructured data such as text documents or social media feeds. The recorded data needs to be stored in a structured format that facilitates further analysis.
8.	Derived variables: Derived variables are new variables created from existing ones through mathematical operations, transformations, or logical conditions. These variables can provide additional insights into the data or simplify complex relationships. For example, calculating the BMI from height and weight variables, or categorizing age groups based on birth year.
9.	Data merge: Data merge involves combining two or more datasets based on a common attribute or key. This is often necessary when the data of interest is spread across multiple sources or tables. For example, merging customer information from a CRM system with sales data from an ERP system using a common customer ID.
10.	Data blending: Data blending is similar to data merge but involves combining data from different sources or databases that may not have a common key. It's commonly used in data visualization tools to create unified views of data from disparate sources. Data blending techniques enable analysts to correlate data from multiple datasets for comprehensive analysis and reporting.
11.	Concatenation: Concatenation involves combining datasets by stacking them either vertically or horizontally. Vertical concatenation appends rows from one dataset to another, typically when datasets have the same variables but different observations. Horizontal concatenation appends columns from one dataset to another, useful when combining datasets with different variables but the same observations.
12.	Data append: Data append is the process of adding new rows of data to an existing dataset. This is often necessary when new observations become available or when updating datasets with additional information. For example, appending new customer orders to an existing sales dataset.
13.	Imputation: Imputation is the process of replacing missing values in a dataset with substituted values. Missing data can arise due to various reasons such as measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or system failures. Imputation techniques include mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, or more sophisticated methods like regression imputation or k-nearest neighbors imputation.
Here are a few approaches an analyst can use for imputing values:
•	Remove Missing Data:  With this approach, you can remove rows with missing values without impacting the quality of your overall analysis.
•	Replace with Zero:  With this approach, you replace missing values with a zero. Whether or not it is appropriate to replace missing data with a zero is contextual. In this case, zero isn't an appropriate value, as a person's weight should be a positive number. In addition, replacing a zero in this case has an extraordinary impact on the overall average weight.
•	Replace with Overall Average:  Instead of using a zero, you can compute the average Weight value for all rows that have data and then replace the missing Weight values with that calculated average.
•	Replace with Most Frequent (Mode):  Alternatively, you can take the most frequently occurring value, called the mode, and use that as the constant.
•	Closest Value Average:  With this approach, you use the values from the rows before and after the missing values. For example, to replace the missing measurements for 2/13/2021 and 2/14/2021, take the values from 2/12/2021 and 2/15/2021 to compute the average.

In summary, data manipulation in data analytics encompasses a range of techniques aimed at preparing and enhancing data for analysis, including recording data, creating derived variables, merging and blending data from multiple sources, concatenating datasets, appending new data, and handling missing values through imputation. These processes are essential for ensuring the quality, integrity, and usability of data for deriving insights and making informed decisions.

•	Reduction: Reduction in the context of data analytics refers to simplifying the dataset by removing unnecessary features, instances, or noise while preserving the essential information. This can lead to more efficient storage, faster processing, and improved model performance. Reduction techniques can be applied to both structured and unstructured data.
•	Dimensionality Reduction: Dimensionality reduction is a specific type of reduction technique focused on reducing the number of input variables or dimensions in a dataset. High-dimensional data can be challenging to visualize and analyze, and dimensionality reduction methods aim to address this issue by reducing the number of features while retaining as much relevant information as possible. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are common techniques used for dimensionality reduction.
•	Numerosity Reduction: Numerosity reduction involves reducing the number of data points or instances in a dataset while preserving the overall characteristics and trends. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets where computational resources are limited or when redundant instances exist. Numerosity reduction techniques include sampling methods such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or cluster-based sampling, as well as data aggregation methods like clustering or summarization.
Each of these reduction techniques plays a crucial role in simplifying data and making it more manageable for analysis, modeling, and interpretation. By applying reduction techniques appropriately, analysts can focus on the most relevant aspects of the data, improve computational efficiency, and gain deeper insights into underlying patterns and relationships.
