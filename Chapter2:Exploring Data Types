Module1-Chapter 2: Exploring Data Types

Data elements

•	Data element is an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values.
•	Dat elements also describe characteristic of activities, including orders, transactions, and events.

In a table, the column headings name the data element while rows is an example of the value 
A data type limits the values a data element can have. the element.
Individual data types support structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Let's explore the differences between these categories.
Tabular Data
•	Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows.
•	A table represents information about a single topic. 
•	Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic. 
•	The contents of each column contain values for the data element as defined by the column header.
•	Each row represents a record of a single instance of the table's topic.
•	Spreadsheets, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers, are practical tools for representing tabular data. 
•	A relational database management system (RDMS), commonly called a database, extends the tabular model. 
•	Instead of having all data in a single table, a database organizes related data across multiple tables. 
•	The connection between tables is known as a relationship. 
•	Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are examples of database software. 
•	Tabular data is the concept that underpins both spreadsheets and relational databases




Structured Data
•	Structured data is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns. 
•	Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet. 
•	With clearly defined column headings, spreadsheets are easy to work with and understand. 
•	In a spreadsheet, cells are where columns and rows intersect.
Common Data types for structured Data 
Character Data Type
•	The character data type limits data entry to only valid characters. 
•	Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard, as well as numbers. 
•	Depending on your needs, multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits.
Alphanumeric Data Type
•	Alphanumeric is the most widely used data type for storing character-based data. 
•	As the name implies, alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters. 
Text Data Type
•	There are times when it is necessary to impose even stricter limits on character-related data to exclude numbers.
Structured data is highly organized and formatted in a way that is easily searchable in relational databases or other forms of data tables where each piece of data is assigned to a specific field or column. This type of data is the backbone of traditional data analysis and is usually handled using standard database management systems. Here are the main types of structured data commonly encountered in data analytics:
Numeric Data:
•	Integer Data: Whole numbers which can represent counts, identifiers (like product codes), or any other data where decimal numbers are not applicable.
•	Floating Point Data: Numbers that require decimals for precision, such as measurements, financial figures, and scientific data.
Textual Data (String Data):
•	Character Strings: Text data stored in character fields used for names, addresses, and other identifiers.
•	Categorical Data: Often stored as text, these represent categories or labels that data points can belong to, such as gender, product types, or department names.
Date and Time Data:
•	Date: Includes only calendar dates (year, month, day) and is crucial for tracking events, historical data, or trends over time.
•	Time: Can include time of day, and like dates, can be important for transaction times, log entries, etc.
•	Timestamps: Combines both date and time in a single value, providing precise tracking of when data records are created or modified.
Boolean Data:
•	Binary Variables: These are typically flags or indicators that store true/false or yes/no decisions, often used to track options or features in data.
Financial Data:
•	Currency: Values representing money that require precise decimal placements and are influenced by currency types.
Geographical Data:
•	Coordinates: Stored as latitude and longitude values, or sometimes as addresses that can be geocoded into spatial coordinates.
•	Regions: Defined by geopolitical boundaries such as cities, states, countries, or custom-defined areas like sales territories.
Identification Data:
•	IDs: Unique identifiers used to link and distinguish records across databases, such as customer IDs, transaction IDs, or serial numbers.
Enumerations:
•	Enum Types: A set of predefined values (like days of the week, states of a process, or stages of a pipeline). Enums help standardize inputs in database fields.

Challenges and Analysis Techniques:
•	Storage and Scalability: While easier to manage than unstructured data, structured data can grow rapidly, requiring scalable database solutions.
•	Data Integrity: Ensuring accuracy and consistency across structured data fields is vital, necessitating regular audits and validations.
•	Query Efficiency: The ability to quickly access and retrieve structured data through queries is crucial, especially as the size of data grows.
Tools and Technologies:
•	Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS): Tools like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server are commonly used for managing structured data.
•	Data Warehousing Solutions: Technologies such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake that provide optimized query performance and integration with analytics tools.
•	ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Tools: Software like Talend, Informatica, and Apache NiFi help in managing the data lifecycle of structured data from extraction to reporting.
Structured data remains fundamental in data analytics, providing a reliable and easily manageable foundation for analyzing and reporting that drives business intelligence and decision-making processes.


Strong And Weak Typing
•	Data types define values placed in columns. 
•	Strong typing is when technology rigidly enforces data types. 
•	A database column defined as numeric only accepts numerical values.
•	You will get an error if you attempt to enter characters into a numeric column.
Weak typing loosely enforces data types. 
•	Spreadsheets use weak typing to help make it easier for people to accomplish their work. 
•	Spreadsheets default to an “automatic” data type and accommodate practically any value. 
•	When a person specifies a data type, it is loosely enforced compared to a database. For example, with a numeric spreadsheet cell, the software does not stop you from entering and storing characters.
•	Software that uses weak typing can be helpful. That said, be mindful that you may experience unexpected and perhaps incorrect results.
Unstructured Data Types
•	Unstructured data is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model.
•	Examples of unstructured data include digital images, audio recordings, video recordings, and open-ended survey responses.
•	 Analysing unstructured data creates a wealth of information and insight.
•	Many people have camera-enabled smartphones, and using video for conversations and meetings is commonplace.
•	 To capture and analyse unstructured data, we make use of data types designed explicitly for that purpose.

•	Unstructured data refers to any data that does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a predefined manner. In the context of data analytics, unstructured data is particularly challenging because it requires more effort to process and analyze than structured data. Here are the main types of unstructured data commonly encountered in data analytics:
•	Text Data:
•	Documents: This includes a wide range of text files, such as PDFs, Word documents, and plain text files. Documents can contain a mix of text, images, and formatting which can complicate analysis.
•	Emails: Emails are a rich source of unstructured data, encompassing both the structured elements (like sender, recipient, and timestamp) and unstructured body text.
•	Social Media Posts: Text data from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, which often contains informal language, slang, emojis, and hashtags.
•	Multimedia Data:
•	Images: Photos and graphics that may contain relevant information for fields such as retail (product images), medicine (medical scans), or security (surveillance photos).
•	Videos: Video content from sources like security cameras, user-generated content, or professional broadcasts. Video data is especially complex due to its size and the temporal dimension.
•	Audio: Recordings from customer service calls, meetings, or environmental sounds. Audio data requires processing to extract features like speaker identity, sentiment, or specific spoken words.
•	Web Data:
•	Web Pages: The content of web pages, which can include text, images, and other multimedia, as well as structured data like HTML or JavaScript code.
•	Blogs and News Articles: Typically text-heavy, these sources may also include multimedia elements and links to other resources.
•	Sensor Data:
•	IoT Devices: Data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which can be highly varied, ranging from temperature sensors to motion detectors, often in real-time.
•	Telematics: Data from vehicles, such as location, speed, and engine health, which are crucial for industries like logistics and automotive.
•	Biometric Data:
•	Fingerprints, facial recognition: Used primarily in security and law enforcement, but increasingly in consumer applications like unlocking smartphones.
•	Genetic Data: Sequences of DNA, relevant in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and criminal investigation.
•	Business Data:
•	Meeting Transcripts and Notes: Often captured as free-form text, needing processing to extract actionable items or decisions.
•	Customer Feedback and Surveys: Text responses that need natural language processing to derive sentiment and insights.
•	Challenges and Analysis Techniques:
•	Storage and Management: Unstructured data is typically voluminous and requires substantial storage solutions, often necessitating scalable cloud storage options.
•	Processing and Analysis: Techniques like natural language processing (NLP), image processing, and machine learning are used to extract usable information from unstructured data.
•	Integration: Combining insights from unstructured data with structured data to gain a comprehensive view of the dataset.
•	Tools and Technologies:
•	NLP Tools: Libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and BERT models for text analysis.
•	Image and Video Processing: OpenCV, TensorFlow, and other deep learning frameworks to analyze visual content.
•	Data Management Systems: Big data platforms like Apache Hadoop and Spark are often used to handle and process large volumes of unstructured data.
•	

Amongst the two categories of data mentioned above, not all data fits neatly in them.
We also have Semi- structured data category.
Semi- structured data
•	Semi-structured data represents the space between structured spreadsheets and unstructured videos.
