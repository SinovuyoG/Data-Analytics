Module1-Chapter 2: Exploring Data Types

Data elements

•	Data element is an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values.
•	Dat elements also describe characteristic of activities, including orders, transactions, and events.

In a table, the column headings name the data element while rows is an example of the value 
A data type limits the values a data element can have. the element.
Individual data types support structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Let's explore the differences between these categories.
Tabular Data
•	Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows.
•	A table represents information about a single topic. 
•	Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic. 
•	The contents of each column contain values for the data element as defined by the column header.
•	Each row represents a record of a single instance of the table's topic.
•	Spreadsheets, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers, are practical tools for representing tabular data. 
•	A relational database management system (RDMS), commonly called a database, extends the tabular model. 
•	Instead of having all data in a single table, a database organizes related data across multiple tables. 
•	The connection between tables is known as a relationship. 
•	Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are examples of database software. 
•	Tabular data is the concept that underpins both spreadsheets and relational databases




Structured Data
•	Structured data is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns. 
•	Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet. 
•	With clearly defined column headings, spreadsheets are easy to work with and understand. 
•	In a spreadsheet, cells are where columns and rows intersect.
Common Data types for structured Data 
Character Data Type
•	The character data type limits data entry to only valid characters. 
•	Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard, as well as numbers. 
•	Depending on your needs, multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits.
Alphanumeric Data Type
•	Alphanumeric is the most widely used data type for storing character-based data. 
•	As the name implies, alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters. 
Text Data Type
•	There are times when it is necessary to impose even stricter limits on character-related data to exclude numbers.
 Excluding numbers can be achieved using the text data type. Closely related to the alphanumeric data type, it is even more stringent. It is helpful to think of text as a subset of alphanumeric, only allowing the storage of alphabetic characters. One practical use of the text data type is to improve the overall data quality.

Strong And Weak Typing
•	Data types define values placed in columns. 
•	Strong typing is when technology rigidly enforces data types. 
•	A database column defined as numeric only accepts numerical values.
•	You will get an error if you attempt to enter characters into a numeric column.
Weak typing loosely enforces data types. 
•	Spreadsheets use weak typing to help make it easier for people to accomplish their work. 
•	Spreadsheets default to an “automatic” data type and accommodate practically any value. 
•	When a person specifies a data type, it is loosely enforced compared to a database. For example, with a numeric spreadsheet cell, the software does not stop you from entering and storing characters.
•	Software that uses weak typing can be helpful. That said, be mindful that you may experience unexpected and perhaps incorrect results.
Unstructured Data Types
•	Unstructured data is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model.
•	Examples of unstructured data include digital images, audio recordings, video recordings, and open-ended survey responses.
•	 Analysing unstructured data creates a wealth of information and insight.
•	Many people have camera-enabled smartphones, and using video for conversations and meetings is commonplace.
•	 To capture and analyse unstructured data, we make use of data types designed explicitly for that purpose.
Amongst the two categories of data mentioned above, not all data fits neatly in them.
We also have Semi- structured data category.
Semi- structured data
•	Semi-structured data represents the space between structured spreadsheets and unstructured videos.
