# CHAPTER1-The Data Analyst

Three pillars of Golden Age of Analytics
•	Data
•	Storage
•	Computing

# Data Analytic Processes:
-Are sequential or interrelated actions that may be revisited while working with data sets.
-For example,
	an analyst reviewing a visualization may notice unusual data points that do not seem to belong in the dataset, causing them to return to the data cleaning stage
and rerun their analysis with the newly cleaned dataset.
Similarly, an analyst running an analysis might discover that their analysis would be enriched by adding another source of data, causing them to return to the data acquisition stage.


•	Data Acquisition
o	Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,
o	
•	Data cleaning and Manipulation
o	Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
o	
•	Data Analysis
o	Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,
o	Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.
o	
•	Data Visualization
o	Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,
o	Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.
o	
•	Reporting and Communication
-This process is meant to help you understand the different activities that take place during a data analysis effort and the approximate order in which they typically occur.


# DATA ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES

•	Descriptive analytic
•	Predictive analytics
•	Prescriptive analytics

Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning
Artificial Intelligence
•	Artificial intelligence (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior. 
•	it is not possible for a modern computer to function at the level of complex reasoning found in the human mind, but you can try to mimic some small portions of human behavior and judgment.
Machine Learning
•	Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques. 
•	ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems to discover new knowledge. Or, in other terms, ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.
Deep Learning
•	Deep learning is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. 
•	It is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most used for image, video, and sound analysis.
